# Investment Portfolio Manager - TODO

This folder contains planning documents and task lists for the Investment Portfolio Manager project.

## 📁 Planning Documents

- **[CURRENCY_CONVERSION_PLAN.md](./CURRENCY_CONVERSION_PLAN.md)** - Plan for multi-currency support implementation

## 💡 Maybe Someday (Only If Actually Needed)

These are ideas that might be useful but aren't priorities unless there's a real use case:

- User authentication (if deploying publicly or multi-user need)
- Portfolio rebalancing (if wanted for personal use)
- Export functionality (PDF/Excel) (if needed for reporting)
- Mobile responsive improvements (if using on phone regularly)
- Performance metrics improvements (TWR, MWR, Sharpe ratio) (if wanted)

**Philosophy**: The project is feature complete for current needs. Only add features when:
1. Personal workflow needs them
2. IBKR integration requires them
3. Someone specifically requests them

## 🐛 Known Issues

If you encounter these, fix them:
- Date handling across timezones (IBKR imports)
- Rounding errors in multi-portfolio allocations
- Modal scrolling on small screens
- IBKR token expiration handling
